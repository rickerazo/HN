# HN neurons: code for analysis of electrophysiology data.  
Open-source python scripts to import, plot, and analyze signal from AxoClamp.  
Context neuroscience and Central Pattern Generator Networks, data input: .atf file, output: voltage traces, calculated cytosol sodium concentration; neuron activity: burst duration, interburst interval, cycle period, and spiking frequency.  
Code developed for analysis of leech Central Pattern Generator heartbeat interneurons (HN Neurons)
