The name of each file has the code tag output from pClamp: + the parameters of the representation of the figures, gp or IpumpMax. traces describes signals inside graph
##example:
18914000_traces_IpumpMax=0.5_gp=3.5.png

#All of my experiments begin their file ID with '19' because they were performed this year, and your experiments begin with fileID '18'


The rationale behind the name behind the stat summary graphs is:
letters 'p' or 'g'p' represent the parameter that remains constant through the sweep
if 'p', the constant parameter is IpumpMax while gp sweeps in multiple values
If 'gp' the constant parameter is gp while IpumpMax sweeps in multiple values

suffix 'BD,IBI, and T represent' burst duration, interburst interval, and period correspondingly.
Ipump_cytNa stands for the graph that plots activation of Ipump and Cytosol Sodium concentration
